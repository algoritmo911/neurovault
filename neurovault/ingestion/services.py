    # The user's suggestion did not include a transaction, but it is best practice
    # to wrap this in a transaction to ensure atomicity.
    # The user's test also mocks `run`, not `begin_transaction`, so I will use that.
    # However, the user's router example returns a result, so I will make the service
    # return a result as well.

    # Let's stick closer to the user's test mock.
    # The user's test mocks `session.run`. This means the test expects `run` to be called
    # on the session directly, not on a transaction object.
    # This is not ideal for production code, but I will follow the user's lead for the test.
    # I will add a comment to explain this.

    # After re-reading the user's suggestion, their test mocks `session.run`.
    # This is probably a simplification for the test.
    # A real implementation should use a transaction.
    # I will use a transaction here, and I will adjust the test mock later if needed.
    # The user's test also mocks `run` as an async function, so `tx.run` should be awaited.
