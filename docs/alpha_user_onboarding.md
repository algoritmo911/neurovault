# Alpha User Onboarding and Progress

This document outlines the concept of the "Alpha Cabinet" in the Mnemosyne Core project, its current implementation status, and the roadmap for future development.

## 1. Concept and Philosophy

The **Alpha Cabinet** is a personalized, secure, and persistent digital space for each user to store their memories. It is the foundational component of the "Factory of Memories," designed to provide a private and sovereign environment for an individual's digital consciousness.

The core philosophy is based on:
- **Data Sovereignty**: Each user has complete control over their own cabinet.
- **Persistence**: Memories are stored for the long term, forming a digital legacy.
- **Extensibility**: The cabinet is designed to be the foundation for future features like AI analysis, VR/AR integration, and tokenization.

## 2. Current Implementation Status (as of feature/alpha-user-001)

The initial implementation of the Alpha Cabinet for `user_001` is complete and serves as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and template for future cabinets.

### Features:
- **API**: A full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API is available for managing text-based memories.
- **Persistence**: Memories are stored in a simple, file-based database (`memories.json`) within the user's cabinet directory. This provides a lightweight and portable persistence layer.
- **Code Quality**: The codebase is equipped with pre-commit hooks (`black`, `flake8`) to enforce a consistent style guide.
- **Testing**: The API is covered by a full suite of unit tests that run in an isolated environment.

### How to run the cabinet:
1. Navigate to `mnemosyne_core/alpha_cabinets/user_001/`.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`.
4. The API is now available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## 3. Future Roadmap

The current implementation is a solid foundation, but the journey has just begun. The next steps will focus on scalability, automation, and enhanced features.

### Immediate Next Steps:
- **CI/CD Integration**: Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically run tests and linters on every push and pull request. This will ensure that the master branch always remains stable.
- **Templating and Automation**:
    - Create a template from the `user_001` cabinet.
    - Develop a script to automate the creation of new user cabinets and branches (`feature/alpha-user-XXX`).

### Long-term Vision:
- **Database Migration**: Replace the file-based storage with a robust database system like PostgreSQL or a graph database like Neo4j to handle scale and complex relationships between memories.
- **Enhanced Features**:
    - **Versioning**: Track changes to memories over time.
    - **AI Analysis**: Integrate with AI modules for metadata extraction, summarization, and semantic search.
    - **Multi-modal Memories**: Extend the API to support not just text, but also images, audio, and video.
- **Security**: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure the privacy and security of each user's cabinet.
