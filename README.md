# Mnemosyne Core

Mnemosyne Core is a next-generation memory management system designed for stability, scalability, and high performance. This project aims to perform a full upgrade of the core, including integration with SC VR, asynchronous synchronization, and dynamic monitoring.

## Project Goals

*   **Stability:** Achieve maximum stability with minimal bugs.
*   **Scalability:** Ensure the system can handle large-scale data and operations.
*   **Performance:** Optimize all modules to work without lags or performance bottlenecks.
*   **Automation:** Implement full automation for testing, deployment, and monitoring.

## Branches

This repository follows a multi-branch development model:

*   `main`: The stable, production-ready foundation of Mnemosyne Core.
*   `dev`: The primary branch for active development and integration.
*   `feature/*`: Branches for developing new features (e.g., `feature/katana-dynamic-monitoring`).
*   `feat/*`: Branches for foundational modules (e.g., `feat/memory-module`).

## Common Principles

*   All commits must be linked to an issue and have a clear description.
*   Code reviews are mandatory for all changes.
*   All tests must pass in the CI/CD pipeline.
*   Documentation must be kept up-to-date.
